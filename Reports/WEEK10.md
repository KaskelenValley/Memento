This week I did solve some problems with Heroky dynos sleepings. I had to change it from 3AM till 9AM. And also I added the deployment of diploma project which is a pdf file. I did it with a help of awesome vscode plugin called [Latex Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop). I'm still researching on how to optimize the server and looking for the way to avoid auto-pinger.

This week I did some research from the user experience point of view, in different mobile apps, which have a similar structure with record-keeping. 
As a result of the analysis, I made a low-fidelity prototype, the frameworks of the pages. I drew a design where a user records audio, pages where recordings are stored and additional pages apart from the main ones, such as delete a record, edit a record and so on. Also, there were adjustments to the ui part, changed fonts and colors of the existing design.

This week I have held a meeting for the 6th sprint and set new deadlines due to new bugs and issues in the app. Then I have made a research among similar applications and highlighted their features in order to provide SUS-test next week. Also I have prepared necessary materials for customer journey map that will help us navigate further. In the middle of the week I have checked the state of our MVP and discussed current bugs and errors with frontend developer and designer.

This week I made a service that converts audio from ogg to wav. Safari doesn't not support the ogg audio format, so we decided to convert to another supported audio format. I also made a streaming speech recognition service. Node.js acts as a gRPC client for Yandex Speechkit API and also as a server for the websocket.

This week I created components for the main page, and also connected the service to the database, which allows you to read, delete and edit content. It was possible to set up a connection using sockets for streaming voice recognition and test it on devices
