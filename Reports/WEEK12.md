This week I helped my frontend developer with the new design on record page. Also, I refactored the code a bit. Then, I configured the new server to sleep like the other services. Finally, I researched platforms where we could write our diploma document on LaTEX and ended up with the decision to use both vscode and overleaf.

This week I have used System Usability Scale and provided UX-testing of our app in order to detect possible errors and bugs. I found some students to test three apps such as Vono, Journify and Memento. Also I have started writing an introduction to the document including some research about cognitive diseases.

This week I collected data and trained a baseline sentimental analysis model. I also added a separate endpoint in the backend for this service.

This week I did some code refactoring, stylistic changes and added new components and pages according to the design. The main page was changed and work was done on the authorization page. Auxiliary libraries for styling the project have also been added.
