This week I have been working on SSL certificate for our mood tracker service. I was trying to achieve that with Let's Encrypt free SSL certificates. Also, I deployed all of our services to production and added a domain name for the main app. There were also some bug fixes. Over all, I am working on the documentation of the application.

This week I have been working on diploma thesis where I have started writing Chapter 4. This chapter is about implementation of the project. It is divided into several parts with a detailed information about each memberâ€™s contribution. In addition, it contains the structure of the app, including some technology data. In order to write the 4th chapter in a proper way I have searched for similar examples of other diploma templates and highlighted the best ones. I have also added some information from our custdevs and SUS-testings for accuracy. At the end of the sprint I would like to conduct one more testing for detecting the rest of the bugs.

I've been supervising the design and layout process this week. Left comments on elements that were not done according to the drawings.There were design refinements on features to automatically add a mood to each entry, with input functions and using a filter to search for entries. Worked on the ability to edit tags and sentiment which the program detects and generates automatically by text, for the accuracy of our functions to determine the sentiment. There were also improvements on the profile pages and on the page of statistics on the use of the application.

This week I optimized the streaming speech recognition service. I added an automatic disconnect from gRPC SpeechKit API if the user does not send any messages. This way we save API resources and bypass potential bugs. I also did code refactoring and documentation, and optimized code where possible.

This week I was busy fixing bugs and developing a page with user statistics. A beautiful graph was developed with the output of all user activities, thanks to which he will be able to understand on which days he was more active, how many entries were made, and so on. Many pages lack smooth animation, so work on this has been started. Now navigating through the application has become more pleasant
