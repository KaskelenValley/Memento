This week I started researching Yandex Speechkit v3 since we decided to use Node.js for asynchronous speech recognition service. I worked on the template backend on Node.js and now we have to solve the problem with `pcm` audio format. Also, I registered aws account and created a necessary bucket. Now, I need more researching about the aws bills since it possibly may cost a lot for our team.

This week, I conducted a competitive analysis of the app based on user experience and functionality. Developed detailed mobile app wireframes for the Splash screen, OnBoarding, and Registration sections.
Also, after discussing with the team the possible options of colors, mudboard, references, and deciding on the design based on this, I created several options for the design of the home page

This week I added new features to the backlog, but since we are building the wireframe, the features from the custdev are at the bottom in order of priority. We also discussed with the designer possible color options for the future application. Together with the team leader, we discussed the reasons for a slight stagnation, and also changed the product development strategy, revising the goals. I also started researching the material regarding the thesis.

It was decided to use Node.js as the language for streaming speech recognition. This is necessary in order to have less delay. But synchronous recognition will remain in python, because a delay of a couple of tens of milliseconds is not critical for synchronous recognition. We will look at the Internet status, if the Internet is fast and has low latency - we use streaming speech recognition, if not - synchronous. At the moment there is a template backend Node.js service and streaming recognition on gRPC is being finalized

This week I added some new features to our project. An authorization page was created, a couple of add-ons to optimize the project, and several new auxiliary libraries were installed. I also discussed the main points of our application with the designer, exchanged tips and came to a common decision.
