Since we've made a decision to change our architecture I need to research how to deploy an async app with data streaming capabilities. I'm still in the proccess, but I already created a pipeline and reserved an app for our new service.
I've read a bit about Firebase Storage and created a testing storage.

This week I've been investigating how streaming works, reviewing the list of libraries, and fixing compatibility issues with the safari browser. I also added authorization through social networks and created components for the audio recording page

This week we tried to create a client on gRPC. But unfortunately web gRPC does not support client-side and bidirectional streaming. We have developed another architecture of communication for bidirectional streaming. And now we're researching libraries and tools for data streaming (audio and text).

This week I changed the visual elements in the design on the home page. I made revisions to the registration section at the developer's request. I drew a quote page and a menu page for adding voice recordings and mood tracking. Also in development are the main record-keeping pages
