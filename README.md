## Project

Memento - a mobile application that helps you to remember your daily highlights. Basically it's an audio diary or journaling app that helps you to record your daily activities and save them in a cloud. With a powerful searching engine you're able to find any memory that you've recorded. You can also share your recordings with your friends and family. *Never forget the matter!*
