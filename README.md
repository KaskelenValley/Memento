## Project

Memento is an application that helps you to remember your daily highlights. Basically it's an audio diary or journaling app that helps you to record your daily activities and save them in a cloud. With a powerful searching engine you're able to find any memory that you've recorded. You can also share your recordings with your friends and family. *Memento - your second memory!*

## User Personas

The 1st user: Berik the dyslexic  
Occupation: artist/ graphic designer  
Age: 27  
Gender: male  
Location: Almaty, Kazakhstan  
Education: Art School  

Description: Berik is an artist who suffers from dyslexia. He likes to read books, but has to do it by audiobooks. Berik is a creative person that likes to take some quick notes, sketches while he has an inspiration. It would be really easy for him to record his ideas using audio journaling and after that to send the converted text to his clients.  

The 2nd user: Galmyzhan Ata the pensioner  
Occupation: pensioner
  Age: 67
  Gender: male
  Location: Semey, Kazakhstan
  Education: Polytechnic institute

  Description: Galymzhan Ata is a pensioner with dementia. The doctors advised him to write down everything he had done earlier in a diary and reread it. But since Galymzhan gets tired of constantly writing down his thoughts, it is easier for him to record them on a dictaphone. However, listening to your audio recordings is completely inconvenient, so an audio journaling will help him with this, converting speech into text.

The 3d user: Alina the student
  Occupation: -
  Age: 19
  Gender: female
  Location: Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan
  Education: IT 

  Description: Alina is a student whose studies fell during the pandemic and online learning. Due to the huge amount of information, it is very difficult for her to constantly write notes of long lectures. An audio journaling integrated into the zoom will help solve her problem, recording the speech of the teacher and converting it into text.

## Non-Functional requirements

- The application must be built in React
- The application must be hosted on Heroku
- The application must use Yandex SpeechKit voice recognition framework
- The application must use FastAPI for ML backend services

## Risks

- There may be problems integrating the [Yandex SpeechKit](https://cloud.yandex.ru/services/speechkit) voice recognition framework
- There may be problems with recognition of names, company names and the like, which can frustrate the user
- Speech recognition performance may not be good enough that the user may prefer to write by hand rather than record the voice
